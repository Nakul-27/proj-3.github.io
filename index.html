LU, CALVIN '24 Co: A4. Conversation with CDT. 
CDT Lu helped me with ensuring my plots looked good and provided feedback on their styles. 
I was in a spot where I was happy with how the plots looked and wanted a second pair of eyes.
CDT Lu took a look and provided feedback on making the stroke of the India Plot white and making it more opaque. 
This helped me fine tune the graphs and have them look better in my opinon.

        <h1>Population Density of India</h1>

                <div>
                    India boasts a stunning 1.408 billion people population. 
                    While this comes with increadible advantages, such as a rapidly developing middle class and economy, there are also undeniable roadblocks.
                    For one, the India's infrastructure is not able to support the population density of large swaths of the nation.
                    This is evidenced by 6-10 lane highways being in near stand-still traffic for hours every day.
                    This impacts the basic necessities of these cities, such as emergency services, with people often dying in ambulances due to an inability to reach the hospital.
                </div>
                <br>
                <br>
                <div>
                    There were the datasets utilized (Note: Please Download One of the TIF files to view the Population Density Map):
                    <ol>

                        <li> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/141rnpK4BL1NN33DFT2lExAUDVZzvIc_a/view?usp=sharing">India Population Density 2016 TIF File</a> </li>
                        <li> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13T-xOcE03OX-yfY-xBQ2MP4yVIU19tUZ/view?usp=sharing">India Population Density 2018 TIF File</a> </li>

                    </ol>
                    The first one is population data from Macrotrends that had the population and % change from the previous year. Note that I only considered data starting at the year 2000.
                    The Raster Data is from the <a href="https://data.humdata.org/dataset/worldpop-population-density-for-india">Humanitarian Data Index</a> and contains population density files from 2016 to 2020. I chose to look at intervals of 2 years, hence 2016, 2018, and 2020.
                </div>
                <br>
                <br>
                <div>
                    <b>I originally hypothesized that India, more specifically its major cities, were becoming too saturated from a population standpoint. </b>
                    The data tells a slightly different story; however. 
                    We can see that India is incredibly densely populated, with major cities being much more densely populated than other regions.
                    And while India is growing its population at a decreasing rate, it appears that major cities are both increasing and decreasing in growth rate.
                    Note that a 2.5% growth rate in a major city can be an additional 250,000 people.
